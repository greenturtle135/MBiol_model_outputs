# MBiol_model_outputs
Bayesian model regression model outputs are stored in this repository. This Masters project investigates the impact of social behaviour on gut-dwelling communities (both the gut parasitome and microbiome).

This study investigates 3 key questions: 

1. Does social centrality predict the parasitome or microbiome?
  a. Social centrality and parasite infection status
  b. Social centrality and parasitome richness
  c. Social centrality and microbiome richness

2. Does social association or spatial proximity predict similarity in parasitome or microbiome communities?
  a. Social/ spatial proximity predicting parasitome similarity
  b. Social/ spatial proximity predicting microbiome similarity

3. Do different aspects of social centrality predict parasitome or microbiome richness?
