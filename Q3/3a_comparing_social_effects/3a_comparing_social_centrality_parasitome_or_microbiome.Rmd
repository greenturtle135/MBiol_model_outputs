## Comparing the effect of different aspects of social centrality on parasitome or microboime richness

I scaled parasitome and microbiome richness separately between 0 and 100 and combined the datasets. I constructed a Bayesian Poisson regression model to test the effect of the interaction between community (microbiome/ parasitome) and scaled richness. I included covariates (sex-reproductive status, age, month, sample mass) and random effects of individual ID and sample ID.

Comparing effect of degree on microbiome/ parasitome richness
```{r}
deg_mp <- readRDS("deg_inter3.rds")
summary(deg_mp)
```

Comparing effect of eigenvector centrality on microbiome/ parasitome richness
```{r}
eig_mp <- readRDS("eig_inter_6.rds")
summary(eig_mp)
```
