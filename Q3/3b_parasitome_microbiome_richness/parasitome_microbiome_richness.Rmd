## Parasitome richness predicting microbiome richness
Bayesian Poisson regression model predicting microbiome richness as a function of parasitome richness and covariates (sex-reproductive status, age, read depth, month). Random effect of individual ID is included.

para_mic<- readRDS("richness_m_d_bayes_4.rds")
